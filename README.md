# Web Forum

This is a web forum built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. It includes the common functionalities of a forum, giving users an option to add new posts and add comments on existing posts. In addition, users can perform searches to find previous posts and comments. 

How to test the web forum on your own local/remote server: 
1. Download all files and go to 'config.php' file 
2. Change parameter in '$db' variable to point to a file path where you want to store the web forum's database.
